If you're running into errors when running the code on iOS or in an environment that doesn't fully support Spark, we can make sure the model is completely written in **PySpark** and adheres to Spark’s distributed environment. Below is an updated version that uses **PySpark’s MLlib** for all operations and avoids issues with environments that don't support specific Python libraries like `mlflow` on iOS.

Here’s the **PySpark-only** version that should run in a Spark environment, without depending on external libraries like MLflow or other non-Spark-specific features:

### Full PySpark Code (Classification Model)

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import MulticlassClassificationEvaluator

# Assuming final_features_df is already loaded and contains the required feature columns
# Define the feature columns and target column
feature_columns = ['total_lost_work_days', 'performance_score', 'total_medical_cost']  # Replace with actual feature columns
label_column = 'eligibility_status'  # Replace with your actual target column

# Step 1: Prepare the feature vector for modeling
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_columns, outputCol="features")
final_features_vector_df = assembler.transform(final_features_df)

# Select the features and label for classification
classification_data = final_features_vector_df.select("features", label_column)

# Step 2: Split the data into training and testing sets (70% training, 30% testing)
train_data, test_data = classification_data.randomSplit([0.7, 0.3], seed=42)

### Step 3: Logistic Regression Model ###
# Initialize Logistic Regression model
logistic_regression = LogisticRegression(labelCol=label_column, featuresCol="features")

# Train the Logistic Regression model
lr_model = logistic_regression.fit(train_data)

# Make predictions on the test data
lr_predictions = lr_model.transform(test_data)

# Evaluate the Logistic Regression model using accuracy
lr_evaluator = MulticlassClassificationEvaluator(labelCol=label_column, predictionCol="prediction", metricName="accuracy")
lr_accuracy = lr_evaluator.evaluate(lr_predictions)
print(f"Logistic Regression Model Accuracy for {label_column}: {lr_accuracy}")

### Step 4: Random Forest Classifier Model ###
# Initialize Random Forest Classifier model
random_forest_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(labelCol=label_column, featuresCol="features")

# Train the Random Forest Classifier model
rf_model = random_forest_classifier.fit(train_data)

# Make predictions on the test data
rf_predictions = rf_model.transform(test_data)

# Evaluate the Random Forest Classifier model using accuracy
rf_accuracy = lr_evaluator.evaluate(rf_predictions)
print(f"Random Forest Model Accuracy for {label_column}: {rf_accuracy}")
```

### Key Points:

1. **No External Dependencies**: This code uses only PySpark's built-in `MLlib` components and should run smoothly in a Spark environment.
   
2. **Feature Preparation**: We use `VectorAssembler` to combine the feature columns into a single `features` vector.

3. **Train-Test Split**: The data is split into training (70%) and test (30%) sets for model evaluation.

4. **Logistic Regression & Random Forest**: Both models are trained using PySpark’s MLlib classes, and predictions are made on the test set.

5. **Evaluation**: The accuracy of both models is evaluated using the `MulticlassClassificationEvaluator`.

### Next Steps:

1. **Run in a Spark Environment**: Ensure you’re running this in a PySpark-supported environment (like Databricks, local PySpark setup, or a cloud Spark cluster). It will not run on environments like iOS or local environments without PySpark.

2. **Check Column Names**: Ensure the `feature_columns` and `label_column` match the column names in your actual dataset.

3. **Expand or Modify**: You can extend the model to include other classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) or different models as needed.
