If you are experiencing issues with `VectorAssembler`, we can manually create the feature vector by combining the columns without relying on `VectorAssembler`. Below is the code to manually handle feature combinations and build classification models without `VectorAssembler`.

### Full PySpark Code Without `VectorAssembler`:

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import array
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import MulticlassClassificationEvaluator

# Assuming final_features_df is already loaded and contains the required feature columns
# Define the feature columns and target column
feature_columns = ['total_lost_work_days', 'performance_score', 'total_medical_cost']  # Replace with actual feature columns
label_column = 'eligibility_status'  # Replace with your actual target column

# Step 1: Combine feature columns into an array manually
# Here we create a new column "features" which is an array of all feature columns
final_features_vector_df = final_features_df.withColumn("features", array(*feature_columns))

# Select only the features and label columns for training
classification_data = final_features_vector_df.select("features", label_column)

# Step 2: Split the data into training and testing sets (70% training, 30% testing)
train_data, test_data = classification_data.randomSplit([0.7, 0.3], seed=42)

### Step 3: Logistic Regression Model ###
# Initialize Logistic Regression model
logistic_regression = LogisticRegression(labelCol=label_column, featuresCol="features")

# Train the Logistic Regression model
lr_model = logistic_regression.fit(train_data)

# Make predictions on the test data
lr_predictions = lr_model.transform(test_data)

# Evaluate the Logistic Regression model using accuracy
lr_evaluator = MulticlassClassificationEvaluator(labelCol=label_column, predictionCol="prediction", metricName="accuracy")
lr_accuracy = lr_evaluator.evaluate(lr_predictions)
print(f"Logistic Regression Model Accuracy for {label_column}: {lr_accuracy}")

### Step 4: Random Forest Classifier Model ###
# Initialize Random Forest Classifier model
random_forest_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(labelCol=label_column, featuresCol="features")

# Train the Random Forest Classifier model
rf_model = random_forest_classifier.fit(train_data)

# Make predictions on the test data
rf_predictions = rf_model.transform(test_data)

# Evaluate the Random Forest Classifier model using accuracy
rf_accuracy = lr_evaluator.evaluate(rf_predictions)
print(f"Random Forest Model Accuracy for {label_column}: {rf_accuracy}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Manual Feature Combination**:
   - We use the `array` function from PySpark to manually combine the feature columns (`total_lost_work_days`, `performance_score`, and `total_medical_cost`) into a single column called `features` without using `VectorAssembler`.

2. **Data Splitting**:
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets using a 70/30 split.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Both **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier** models are trained on the combined features.
   - The models are then evaluated on the test set.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The evaluation is done using accuracy for both models, and the results are printed.

### Benefits:

- **No Use of `VectorAssembler`**: This approach avoids `VectorAssembler` and instead uses the native `array` function to combine the features, which should resolve any issues you're encountering.
  
- **Fully Compatible with PySpark**: This code is fully compatible with PySpark and should work in any Spark-supported environment without additional dependencies.

### Next Steps:

- Ensure that the `feature_columns` and `label_column` match the actual column names in your dataset.
- Run this in your Spark environment (e.g., Databricks, local Spark setup, or cloud Spark cluster).
