Since you're using **Databricks Runtime 15.4**, you should be able to use the PySpark API, including `VectorAssembler`, without any issues related to whitelisting, as this is a standard feature in PySpark. Below is the **full correct code** for training **classification models** (Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier) with the appropriate PySpark API usage and MLflow integration.

### Full Correct Code

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import MulticlassClassificationEvaluator
import mlflow
import mlflow.spark

# Assuming final_features_df is already loaded and contains the required feature columns
# Define the feature columns and target column
feature_columns = ['total_lost_work_days', 'performance_score', 'total_medical_cost']  # Replace with actual feature columns
label_column = 'eligibility_status'  # Replace with your actual target column

# Step 1: Prepare the feature vector for modeling
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_columns, outputCol="features")
final_features_vector_df = assembler.transform(final_features_df)

# Select the features and label for classification
classification_data = final_features_vector_df.select("features", label_column)

# Step 2: Split the data into training and testing sets (70% training, 30% testing)
train_data, test_data = classification_data.randomSplit([0.7, 0.3], seed=42)

### Step 3: Logistic Regression Model ###
# Initialize Logistic Regression model
logistic_regression = LogisticRegression(labelCol=label_column, featuresCol="features")

# Train the Logistic Regression model
lr_model = logistic_regression.fit(train_data)

# Make predictions on the test data
lr_predictions = lr_model.transform(test_data)

# Evaluate the Logistic Regression model using accuracy
lr_evaluator = MulticlassClassificationEvaluator(labelCol=label_column, predictionCol="prediction", metricName="accuracy")
lr_accuracy = lr_evaluator.evaluate(lr_predictions)
print(f"Logistic Regression Model Accuracy for {label_column}: {lr_accuracy}")

### Step 4: Random Forest Classifier Model ###
# Initialize Random Forest Classifier model
random_forest_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(labelCol=label_column, featuresCol="features")

# Train the Random Forest Classifier model
rf_model = random_forest_classifier.fit(train_data)

# Make predictions on the test data
rf_predictions = rf_model.transform(test_data)

# Evaluate the Random Forest Classifier model using accuracy
rf_accuracy = lr_evaluator.evaluate(rf_predictions)
print(f"Random Forest Model Accuracy for {label_column}: {rf_accuracy}")

### Step 5: Log the Models and Metrics using MLflow ###
with mlflow.start_run() as run:
    # Log accuracy for Logistic Regression
    mlflow.log_metric("logistic_regression_accuracy", lr_accuracy)
    
    # Log the Logistic Regression model
    mlflow.spark.log_model(lr_model, "logistic_regression_model")
    
    # Log accuracy for Random Forest
    mlflow.log_metric("random_forest_accuracy", rf_accuracy)
    
    # Log the Random Forest model
    mlflow.spark.log_model(rf_model, "random_forest_model")

    print(f"Model run ID: {run.info.run_id}")
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Feature Preparation**:
   - We use the `VectorAssembler` to combine the feature columns into a feature vector called `"features"`.
   - `final_features_df` is the DataFrame containing all features and the target column (`eligibility_status` in this case).

2. **Train-Test Split**:
   - We split the data into 70% training and 30% testing.

3. **Model Training**:
   - **Logistic Regression**: The model is trained using the training data and evaluated using the test data.
   - **Random Forest Classifier**: Similarly, a Random Forest Classifier is trained and evaluated.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The models are evaluated based on **accuracy**, and you can extend this to other metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score using the `MulticlassClassificationEvaluator`.

5. **MLflow Logging**:
   - The models and their accuracy metrics are logged into MLflow for tracking, and the models are stored for future use.

### What You Need to Do:
1. **Replace Feature and Target Columns**: Ensure the column names in `feature_columns` and `label_column` match the ones in your actual dataset.
2. **Ensure Correct Data Loading**: Ensure that `final_features_df` is already loaded from Unity Catalog or Databricks Feature Store with all required columns.
3. **Monitor in MLflow**: After running the code, you can track the results in MLflow (accessible via the Databricks workspace).

### Next Steps:
- You can validate the models or deploy them using MLflow.
- If you encounter further issues or need additional functionality (like hyperparameter tuning), feel free to ask!
